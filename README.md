# VanValkenburghGeneology

The goal of this project is to create a program that can process the data stored in these files, and to use that to construct a visual aide that is more useful than a plaintext/PDF document. Ideally we would like this output to be easily searchable and manipulable for users. I'll update this more as the program develops.
